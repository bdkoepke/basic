\begin{quadratic}
Let $a, b, c$ be real numbers and $a \neq 0$. The solutions of the quadratic equation
\[
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
\]
are given by
\[
x = \cfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
provided that $b^2 - 4ac$ is positive or 0. If $b^2 - 4ac$ is negative, then the equation has no solution in the real numbers.
\end{quadratic}
