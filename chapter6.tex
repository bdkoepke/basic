\newtheorem{mapping}{Mapping}[section]
Mapping of the plane into itself we shall mean an association, which to each point of the plane associates another point of the plane.
\mapping{Let $P$ be a point and $P^\prime$ be a point associated with $P$ by the mapping, we denote this by $P \mapsto P^\prime$}
\definition{The value of the mapping at $P$ is the point $P^\prime$ associated with the value $P$.}
\definition{We also say that $P^\prime$ corresponds to $P$ under the mapping.}
\mapping{If $F$ is a mapping into the plane, then the value of $F$ at $P$ is $F(P)$.}
\definition{The image of $P$ under $F$ is the value $F(P)$ of $F$ at $P$.}
\mapping{$\forall F, G : F \in $ mapping $\iff \forall P, F(P) = G(P)$}
\newtheorem{constantmapping}{Constant mapping}[section]
\constantmapping{$\forall P : $ point $, O \in $ point $, P \mapsto O$}
\definition{Identify: $\forall P : $ point $, I(P) \mapsto P$}
